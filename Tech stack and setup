Since you already have wireframes and requirements for your mental health app prototype, let's dive into the coding specifics! Here's a breakdown of the steps to get started programming, focusing on the frontend development with a React.js and Node.js with Express backend as an example:

1. Project Setup:

    Install Node.js and npm: Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js installed on your system. This will also install npm (Node Package Manager) for managing project dependencies.
    Create a Project Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired project directory. Use mkdir mental-health-app to create the project folder.
    Initialize npm Project: Inside the project directory, run npm init -y to initialize a new npm project. This will create a package.json file that stores project dependencies.

2. Install React and Dependencies:

    Navigate back to your terminal within the project directory.
    Install React using npm: npm install react react-dom. This installs the core React libraries.
    Consider UI component libraries for faster development: npm install @material-ui/core @emotion/react @emotion/styled. These will provide pre-built components for building your UI.
    Install a state management library (optional but recommended for complex apps): npm install redux react-redux. This helps manage application state across components.

3. Set Up Project Structure:

    Create a basic folder structure within your project directory. Here's an example:

    mental-health-app/
      - src/  /* All your React component code goes here */
        - App.js  /* Main app component */
        - components/  /* Subfolder for reusable components */
          - Login.js
          - Dashboard.js
          - MoodTracker.js
          - Schedule.js
          - Surveys.js
      - public/  /* Static assets like images, stylesheets */
        - index.html  /* Entry point for the app */
      - package.json  /* Project dependencies */

4. Create React App (Optional):

    While not strictly necessary, you can use the create-react-app tool for a boilerplate setup with basic configurations. Run npx create-react-app my-app (replace my-app with your desired name) in your terminal. This creates a new React project with a pre-configured structure.

5. Start Coding the UI Components:

    Open App.js and start building the main app component structure using React functional components or class components (depending on your preference).
    Utilize the installed UI component libraries (Material-UI in this example) to build components like buttons, navigation bars, and cards.
    Create separate React components for each screen (Login, Dashboard, Mood Tracker, etc.) within the components folder.
    Refer to your wireframes to translate the design into code, building the UI structure and layout.

6. Integrate Backend (Node.js with Express):

    In a separate directory outside your React project, set up a Node.js project with Express.
    This will handle user authentication, data storage (temporary for the prototype), and API endpoints that the React app will interact with (e.g., fetching appointments, submitting surveys).
    For this prototype, you can use dummy data or a local JSON file to simulate data retrieval and storage.

7. Connect Frontend and Backend (Later Stage):

    Once you have basic functionality on both the frontend and backend, implement APIs on the backend to handle data exchange.
    The React app will make API calls (using libraries like Axios) to fetch data from the backend and potentially send user interactions (mood entries, survey responses).
